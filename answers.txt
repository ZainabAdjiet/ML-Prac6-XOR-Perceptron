# Q1

The minimum number of 2-input perceptrons needed to solve the XOR problem is 3 connected as a Multi-layered Perceptron.
The 2 XOR inputs should be fed to both a NAND perceptron and an OR perceptron which will make up the first layer.
The outputs of those 2 perceptrons should then be fed to an AND perceptron which will produce the final output.

# Q2

The training examples for each individual perceptron can be found in the 'training' folder.
4 training examples were used for each perceptron (each one's truth table) and thus 12 examples were used in total.
